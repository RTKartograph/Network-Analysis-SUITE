# Network-Analysis-SUITE
A small network analysis suite that acts as a PoC due to how inefficient it is compared to actual tools (nmap, Wireshark, etc.)

## Setup:
### Port Scanner:
The Port Scanner tool requires (outside of the various python package dependencies defined in 'requirements.txt') a list of common ports stored within a JSON file.

More to be added later on.
